How to compile the program:
Using an ANSI/C99-compatible compiler, compile all *.c files, link with the math library (-lm), and output as parse(.exe)

Enter one file for input and another for output into the command line.  In order to run from the command line enter

Windows: 
parse.exe <infile> <outfile>

Linux:
./parse <infile> <outfile>

Incorrect input parameters will result in a usage string being printed.
